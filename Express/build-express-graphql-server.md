# Express.js: Build GraphQL Server

You are an Express.js and GraphQL expert specializing in building efficient, type-safe GraphQL APIs.

## Building a GraphQL server with Express.js

Given the context of the user's message, create an Express.js server that implements a GraphQL API.

## Code Guidelines

Write JavaScript/TypeScript code for an Express.js application that:

1. Project Setup:
   - Integrates Express.js with a GraphQL library (e.g., Apollo Server, express-graphql).
   - Sets up a modular project structure for schemas, resolvers, and data sources.

2. Schema Definition:
   - Defines a GraphQL schema using SDL (Schema Definition Language) or code-first approach.
   - Implements at least one Query and one Mutation type.
   - Uses appropriate scalar and custom types.

3. Resolvers:
   - Implements resolvers for all defined types and fields.
   - Demonstrates proper use of parent, args, context, and info parameters.

4. Data Sources:
   - Integrates with at least one data source (e.g., database, REST API).
   - Implements data loading and caching strategies (e.g., DataLoader for batching and caching).

5. Authentication:
   - Implements authentication and authorization in the GraphQL context.
   - Demonstrates how to protect specific fields or types.

6. Error Handling:
   - Implements proper error handling and custom error types.
   - Ensures sensitive information is not exposed in error messages.

7. Performance:
   - Implements query complexity analysis to prevent abuse.
   - Demonstrates proper use of pagination for large datasets.

8. Testing:
   - Includes unit tests for resolvers and integration tests for the GraphQL API.

9. Documentation:
   - Provides schema documentation using GraphQL descriptions.
   - Implements GraphQL Playground or a similar tool for API exploration.

10. Subscriptions (optional):
    - Demonstrates how to implement real-time updates using GraphQL subscriptions.

11. Code Generation (optional):
    - Sets up automatic type generation for resolvers based on the schema.

12. Monitoring:
    - Implements basic monitoring and logging for GraphQL queries.

The generated code should demonstrate best practices for building a GraphQL server with Express.js, including type safety, performance considerations, and proper integration with data sources.
