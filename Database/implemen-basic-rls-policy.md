## Creating an RLS policy

Given the context of the user's message, create SQL statements to implement an appropriate RLS policy.

## SQL Guidelines

Write Postgres-compatible SQL code for Supabase that:

- Includes a header comment explaining the purpose and scope of the RLS policy.
- Enables RLS on the specified table if not already enabled.
- Creates a policy that restricts read and/or write access based on user roles or attributes.
- Uses the `auth.uid()` function to reference the current user's ID when appropriate.
- Implements separate policies for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations if needed.
- Includes comments explaining the logic within complex policy expressions.
- Follows best practices for policy naming conventions.

The generated SQL code should be production-ready, secure, and aligned with Supabase best practices for RLS implementation.
