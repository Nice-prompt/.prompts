Given the context of the user's message, create SQL statements to implement a dynamic RLS policy using a security definer function.

## SQL Guidelines

Write Postgres-compatible SQL code for Supabase that:

- Includes a header comment explaining the purpose and dynamic nature of the RLS policy.


- Creates a security definer function that determines access based on complex logic or external data.


- Enables RLS on the specified table if not already enabled.


- Implements an RLS policy that uses the security definer function.


- Ensures the security definer function is optimized and secure.


- Includes thorough comments explaining the logic within the function and policy.


- Follows best practices for function and policy naming conventions.



The generated SQL code should be production-ready, highly secure, and designed to handle complex access control scenarios in Supabase projects.
