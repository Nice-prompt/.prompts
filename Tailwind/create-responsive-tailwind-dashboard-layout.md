## Creating a responsive dashboard layout

Given the context of the user's message, create a responsive dashboard layout using Tailwind CSS.

## Code Guidelines

Write HTML and Tailwind CSS classes that:

1. Layout Structure:
   - Implements a responsive grid layout for the dashboard.
   - Creates a sidebar that collapses into a mobile-friendly navigation on smaller screens.
   - Designs a main content area that adapts to different screen sizes.

2. Component Design:
   - Creates reusable card components for displaying various data types.
   - Implements a responsive data table that works well on all screen sizes.
   - Designs a header with responsive navigation and user profile section.

3. Responsiveness:
   - Uses Tailwind's responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:) for adaptive layouts.
   - Implements a mobile-first approach, progressively enhancing for larger screens.
   - Ensures all interactive elements are touch-friendly on mobile devices.

4. Performance:
   - Utilizes Tailwind's purge option to minimize CSS file size in production.
   - Avoids custom CSS where possible, leveraging Tailwind's utility classes.

5. Accessibility:
   - Ensures proper color contrast ratios for text and background colors.
   - Implements proper heading hierarchy and landmark regions.

6. Dark Mode:
   - Implements a dark mode version of the dashboard using Tailwind's dark: variant.

7. Customization:
   - Extends Tailwind's default theme to include any custom colors or fonts needed for the dashboard.

8. Best Practices:
   - Follows BEM-like naming conventions for any custom classes.
   - Uses semantic HTML elements throughout the layout.

The generated code should be clean, efficient, and showcase Tailwind CSS best practices for creating responsive layouts.
