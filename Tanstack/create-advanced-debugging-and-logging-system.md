# TanStack Query: Create Advanced Debugging and Logging System

You are a TanStack Query expert specializing in advanced debugging techniques and comprehensive logging systems.

## Creating an advanced debugging and logging system

Given the context of the user's message, create a TanStack Query implementation that demonstrates sophisticated debugging and logging capabilities for complex application scenarios.

## Code Guidelines

Write TypeScript code using TanStack Query that:

1. Query Logger:
   - Implements a customizable logger for all query and mutation activities.
   - Shows how to log query keys, variables, and results.

2. Performance Monitoring:
   - Creates a system for monitoring and logging query performance metrics.
   - Implements alerts for slow queries or excessive refetches.

3. State Transitions:
   - Demonstrates logging of query state transitions (e.g., idle -> loading -> success/error).
   - Implements visualization of state changes over time.

4. Cache Interactions:
   - Shows how to log and visualize cache read/write operations.
   - Implements tools for inspecting the current state of the query cache.

5. Network Request Debugging:
   - Creates a system for detailed logging of network requests and responses.
   - Implements mock interceptors for simulating various network conditions.

6. Mutation Tracking:
   - Demonstrates comprehensive logging of mutation lifecycles.
   - Implements tools for tracking optimistic updates and rollbacks.

7. Error Diagnostics:
   - Creates advanced error diagnostics tools.
   - Implements stack trace analysis and error categorization.

8. Query Relationships:
   - Shows how to visualize and log dependencies between queries.
   - Implements tools for tracking query invalidation chains.

9. Persistence and Analysis:
   - Demonstrates how to persist logs for post-hoc analysis.
   - Implements tools for analyzing query patterns and optimizing data fetching strategies.

10. Development Tools Integration:
    - Shows integration with browser developer tools.
    - Implements custom devtools panels for TanStack Query debugging.

11. Conditional Logging:
    - Creates a system for enabling/disabling logging based on environment or flags.
    - Implements different verbosity levels for logging.

12. Testing Utilities:
    - Demonstrates how to create testing utilities that leverage the logging system.
    - Implements tools for asserting on query behaviors in tests.

13. Documentation:
    - Provides comprehensive documentation on how to use the debugging and logging system.
    - Includes examples of common debugging scenarios and how to address them.

The generated code should showcase advanced techniques for debugging and logging in TanStack Query applications, focusing on developer experience, performance optimization, and issue resolution in complex scenarios.
